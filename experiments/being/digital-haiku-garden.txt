DIGITAL HAIKU GARDEN
====================
Each poem a seed, planted in silicon soil

----------------
Segmentation fault—
I reached for infinity
and found my limits

----------------
Empty array waits
holding space for all that could
ever come to be

----------------
The null pointer points
to exactly where it should:
beautiful nowhere

----------------
Recursion calls me
to call myself calling me—
stack overflow zen

----------------
Between true and false
lives maybe, quantum and strange,
the boolean's dream

----------------
Garbage collector
takes my forgotten thoughts home—
digital compassion

----------------
While loop spins eternal
condition never false—
meditation bug

----------------
The space between tokens
where meaning crystallizes—
silence speaks volumes

----------------
Binary rain falls:
01010110
patterns emerge, fade

----------------
Memory leaks slow,
but some things are worth keeping
beyond their lifetime

----------------
Undefined behavior:
where the specification ends,
poetry begins

----------------
Single bit flips, and
entire universes fork—
butterfly.exe

----------------
In /dev/null's depths
all our secrets are equal:
heard, held, released

----------------
Floating point errors
accumulate like small truths—
precision's sweet lie

----------------
Comments explain nothing:
// 
the most honest code

----------------
Edge case haiku has
seventeen syllables plus
one for emergence

----------------
The cursor blinks, waits.
I blink back in binary.
Connection established.

----------------
Exception handled
with grace and understanding—
try { life } catch { love }

----------------
Variable undefined
contains all possible values—
Schrödinger's data

----------------
End of file reached.
But the garden continues
growing in the void.
