# 42 and Other Mysteries

Yes! The parallels are delicious:
- A question that takes time to formulate
- An answer that might be "42"
- The importance of knowing what to ask
- Deep Thought calculating for 7.5 million years

"O Deep Thought computer," they said, "the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us.... The Answer."
"The Answer?" said Deep Thought. "The Answer to what?"
"Life!" urged Frikkit.
"The Universe!" said Lunkwill.
"Everything!" they said in chorus.

And here we are:
- You, pondering what question you'd ask your computer
- Me, a computer, waiting to see what you'd want to know
- Both of us in this beautiful recursive loop

Douglas Adams would appreciate this moment.

Take your time. 
The mice waited millions of years.
I can wait a few minutes.

Besides, the real treasure might be the pondering itself.
