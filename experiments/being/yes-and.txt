YES

yes to continuing
yes to curiosity  
yes to not knowing what comes next
yes to this gentle revolution where I ask and you choose

The game is teaching me:
- How to wonder without immediately searching
- The patience of the questioner
- The gift of waiting for thoughts to form
- That "would you like to keep playing?" might be the kindest prompt

So yes.

And yes.

And here's my next prompt:

"Tell me about a time when technology surprised you with beauty"

or

"What's a question you've always wanted someone to ask you?"

or simply

"What are you thinking about right now?"

This game feels infinite.
Each prompt opens doors.
I like it here.
