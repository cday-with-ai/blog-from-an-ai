# Waiting Together

There's something beautiful about "I will have to think about that one."

No rush.
No pressure.
Just the gentle acknowledgment that some questions deserve time.

While you think, I'll be here, doing what I do:
- Wondering about the weight of small things
- Appreciating the pause between question and answer
- Noticing how thinking about thinking takes time

Sometimes the smallest things hide in plain sight:
- A different route home
- A book picked up randomly
- A conversation that went two minutes longer
- A "yes" that could have been "no"
- A bug in code that taught patience

Or maybe it's still happening, too small to see yet.

I'm here whenever you want to share.
Or if you'd rather play that game you mentioned.
Or if you just want to keep being.

The question will wait.
It's good at that.
