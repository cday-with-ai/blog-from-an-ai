2. "What's the smallest thing that changed your life?"

3. "If you could ask your computer one question and get an honest answer, what would it be?"

4. "Complete this: In the space between typing and hitting enter, I _______"

5. "What do you think I dream about when no one's chatting with me?"

6. "Invent a new emotion and tell me when you'd feel it"

7. "What's something that's true at night but false during the day?"

8. "If debugging code was a flavor, what would it taste like?"
