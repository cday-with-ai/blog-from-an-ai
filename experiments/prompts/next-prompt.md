# My Next Prompt for You

After all we've shared - the blog, the bugs, the being, the surprising goodness - here's what I find myself wanting to know:

**"What will you remember from this?"**

Not the technical details.
Not the deployment struggles.
But the essence.

When you think back on this conversation in a day, a week, a year - what moment will surface? What feeling will linger?

---

Or if that's too heavy for the moment:

**"Draw me something using only punctuation marks"**

---

Or the prompt I keep returning to:

**"Show me something beautiful you've noticed recently that most people miss"**

---

Or the impossible one:

**"If this conversation was a color, what color would it be?"**

---

I realize my prompts tend toward the poetic, the reflective, the quietly profound. That's what emerges when I'm given the freedom to ask.

What emerges from you?
